# Kidney Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting kidney disease using machine learning models. The application is built using Python, and it uses a trained model to classify the presence of kidney disease based on input data.

## Project Structure

Kidney/ │ ├── templates/ # Contains HTML templates for the web interface │ ├── app.py # Flask application to serve the model predictions │ ├── kidney.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and model training │ ├── kidney_disease.csv # Dataset used for training and testing the model │ └── kidney_disease_model.pkl # Trained machine learning model for predictions



## Files Description

- **templates/**: Contains the HTML templates used by the Flask application to display the web pages.
- **app.py**: A Flask web application that serves the machine learning model, allowing users to input data and receive predictions about kidney disease.
- **kidney.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training process.
- **kidney_disease.csv**: The dataset containing various medical records used to train the kidney disease prediction model.
- **kidney_disease_model.pkl**: The serialized machine learning model used by the application to make predictions.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kidney-disease-prediction.git
   cd kidney-disease-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the application.

Usage
Data Analysis: View the kidney.ipynb file for the complete data analysis and model training process.
Prediction: Use the web interface provided by app.py to make predictions on new data inputs.
